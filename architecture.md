Software architectures can indeed be categorized into broader categories based on how they handle scalability, communication, and structure. Here's a more organized way to classify them:

### **1. Monolithic vs. Distributed Architectures**  
   - **Monolithic Architecture**  
     - Single, tightly integrated system.  
     - Everything is in one application.  
     - Example: Legacy applications.  
   
   - **Distributed Architecture**  
     - The application is split into smaller, independent components.  
     - Can scale more easily and be developed by separate teams.  
     - **Examples**:  
       - **Microservices Architecture**  
       - **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**  
       - **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

### **2. Request-Driven vs. Event-Driven Architectures**  
   - **Request-Driven Architecture (Synchronous)**  
     - Communication is typically synchronous (client requests, server responds).  
     - Example: **Layered Architecture**, **Microservices** (with HTTP APIs), **Monolithic** applications.  
   
   - **Event-Driven Architecture (Asynchronous)**  
     - Communication is asynchronous, based on events.  
     - Components react to events rather than direct requests.  
     - Example: **Event-Driven Architecture**, **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), **Reactive Systems**.  

### **3. Layered vs. Modular Architectures**  
   - **Layered Architecture (N-Tier Architecture)**  
     - Divides the system into layers (presentation, business logic, data access).  
     - Typically follows a strict hierarchy.  
     - Example: **Layered Architecture**, **Clean Architecture** (with a clear separation of concerns).  

   - **Modular (Component-Based) Architecture**  
     - System is composed of loosely coupled modules/components.  
     - Example: **Microkernel Architecture** (plugin-based), **Modular Monolithic Architecture**.

### **4. Cloud-Native and Infrastructure-Based Architectures**  
   - **Serverless Architecture**  
     - Focuses on abstracting infrastructure management.  
     - Uses cloud services (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).  
     - Example: **Serverless Architecture**.  
   
   - **Cloud-Based or Containerized Architectures**  
     - Uses container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes).  
     - Example: **Microservices** deployed using **Kubernetes**.  

### **5. Data-Centric Architectures**  
   - **Data-Centric**  
     - Primarily focuses on managing, storing, and processing data.  
     - Often involves complex database interactions, data pipelines, and analytics.  
     - Example: **Big Data Architectures** (e.g., Hadoop), **Data Lakes**.  
   
   - **Event Sourcing**  
     - Focuses on storing events to rebuild application states, often paired with **CQRS**.  
     - Example: **Event Sourcing** architecture.  

### **6. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) vs. Client-Server Architectures**  
   - **Client-Server Architecture**  
     - A central server responds to client requests.  
     - Common in web applications.  
     - Example: **Traditional web apps**, **Monolithic apps**, **Microservices**.  
   
   - **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**  
     - Each node communicates directly with other nodes without a central server.  
     - Example: **Blockchain**, **BitTorrent**.

### Summary of Categorized Architectures:

#### **Monolithic vs. Distributed**
- **Monolithic**: Single-tiered system (e.g., Legacy apps).
- **Distributed**: Multiple independent services (e.g., Microservices, SOA).

#### **Request-Driven vs. Event-Driven**
- **Request-Driven**: Synchronous communication (e.g., Layered Architecture, Microservices with HTTP).
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication (e.g., EDA, CQRS).

#### **Layered vs. Modular**
- **Layered**: Structured in layers (e.g., Layered Architecture).
- **Modular**: Loosely coupled modules (e.g., Microkernel, Modular Monolithic).

#### **Cloud-Native & Infrastructure**
- **Serverless**: Cloud-managed (e.g., AWS Lambda).
- **Containerized**: Managed via Kubernetes (e.g., Microservices).

#### **Data-Centric Architectures**
- **Data-Centric**: Focus on data (e.g., Big Data, Data Lakes).
- **Event Sourcing**: Rebuilding states from events (e.g., Event Sourcing).

#### **Peer-to-Peer vs. Client-Server**
- **Client-Server**: Centralized (e.g., Web apps).
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Decentralized (e.g., Blockchain, BitTorrent).
